# AI-Shield-Advance-Cyberthreat-detection-using-Machine-Learning-
This project implements an anomaly detection system for network traffic, aiming to identify unusual patterns that may indicate potential security threats such as intrusions, malware activities, or data exfiltration attempts.

âœ¨ Features
Data preprocessing and feature extraction from network traffic datasets

Machine Learning models trained for anomaly detection

Evaluation of model performance using key metrics

Visualization of traffic patterns and anomalies

Scalable design for integration into real-time monitoring systems

ðŸ›  Technologies Used
Python

Scikit-learn

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib / Seaborn

(Add TensorFlow / Keras if your project uses deep learning)

ðŸš€ How to Run
Clone the repository.

Install the required dependencies (pip install -r requirements.txt).

Run the preprocessing scripts to prepare the dataset.

Train the anomaly detection models.

Evaluate and visualize the results.

ðŸ“š Dataset
(Optionally, mention the dataset you used â€” e.g., CICIDS, KDD99, custom, etc.)
